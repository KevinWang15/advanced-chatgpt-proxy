# Advanced ChatGPT Proxy

An advanced proxy system for ChatGPT that uses browser automation to simulate user interactions and avoid triggering
mechanisms that detect the proxy and trigger degradation.

legitimate use cases only. Please note:

- This tool is very hard to deploy, not noob-friendly, you should not attempt to deploy it unless you are a professional
- Use at your own risk - no warranty or support is provided

Due to frequent changes in the code, I am not maintaining a README.md at this time. 

Please review the codebase directly to understand how everything works. This project is not intended for beginners.
